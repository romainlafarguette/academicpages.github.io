We  analyze the  impact of  technology on  production and  trade in  services,
focusing on the foreign exchange  market.  We identify exogenous technological
changes by  the connection of  countries to submarine fiber-optic  cables used
for electronic  trading, but which were  not laid for purposes  related to the
foreign exchange market.   We estimate the impact of cable  connections on the
share of  offshore foreign  exchange transactions.  Cable  connections between
local markets  and matching servers in  the major financial centers  lower the
fixed costs  of trading currencies and  increase the share of  currency trades
occurring onshore.   At the same time,  however, they attenuate the  effect of
standard  spatial frictions  such  as distance,  local  market liquidity,  and
restrictive regulations that otherwise prevent transactions from moving to the
major  financial  centers.   Our  estimates suggest  that  the  second  effect
dominates. Technology  dampens the  impact of  spatial frictions  by up  to 80
percent  and increases,  in net  terms, the  share of  offshore trading  by 21
percentage points.   Technology also  has economically  important implications
for  the  distribution  of  foreign  exchange  transactions  across  financial
centers, boosting the share in global  turnover of London, the world's largest
trading venue, by as much as one-third.
