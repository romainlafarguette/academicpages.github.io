With Barry Eichengreen (Berkeley) and Arnaud Mehl (ECB)

We study  the impact of  technology on the  reaction of financial  markets to
information,  focusing  on  the  foreign exchange  market.   We  contrast  the
"thin-skinned"  view that  technological improvements  cause markets  to react
more to new information with the "thick-skinned" view that they react less. We
pinpoint exogenous technological changes using the timing of the connection of
countries via  the submarine fiber-optic  cables used for  electronic trading.
Cable connections dampen the response of exchange rates to macroeconomic news,
consistent with the "thick-skinned" hypothesis. This  is in line with the view
that  technology  eases  access  to information  and  reduces  trend-following
behavior. According to our estimates, cable connections reduce the reaction of
exchange rates to U.S.  monetary policy news by 50 to 80 percent.
