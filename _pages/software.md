## [Growth at Risk: Density Forecasting via Quantile Regressions and Parametric Fit](https://github.com/IMFGAR/GaR)

## [Distributional GaRCH model to design FX Interventions for Central Banks](https://github.com/romainlafarguette/varfxi)



## [Quantile Local Projections](https://github.com/romainlafarguette/quantileproj)
Python module to estimate quantile local projections, and produce useful outputs for economists
The example notebook is available at https://github.com/romainlafarguette/quantile-local-projections/blob/master/Quantile%20Local%20Projections.ipynb
Based on the QuantileReg package from statsmodels
Based on my conditional quantile sampling module (https://github.com/romainlafarguette/cqsampling)
The quantile uncrossing part is based on either:
    * Chernozhukov et al. (2010) Quantile and Probability Curves Without Crossing, Econometrica
    * Schmidt and Zhu (2016), Quantile Spacings: A Simple Method for the Joint Estimation of Multiple Quantiles Without Crossing
