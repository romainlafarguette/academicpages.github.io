title: "Growth-at-Risk: Concept and Application in IMF Country Surveillance"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gar-applications/
excerpt: "The Growth-at-Risk (GaR) framework  links current macrofinancial conditions to
the distribution of future growth. Its  main strength is its ability to assess
the entire distribution of future GDP growth (in contrast to point forecasts),
quantify macrofinancial risks in terms of growth, and monitor the evolution of
risks to economic activity over time.  By using GaR analysis, policymakers can
quantify the  likelihood of risk scenarios,  which would serve as  a basis for
preemptive action. This paper offers practical  guidance on how to conduct GaR
analysis and  draws lessons from  country case  studies. It also  discusses an
Excel-based GaR  tool developed  to support  the IMF's  bilateral surveillance
efforts."
