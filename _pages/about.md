Welcome ! 欢迎 !

Welcome to the website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文), Ph.D., economist at the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC. 

My  main research  interests  lie  in the  fields  of  monetary and  financial
economics with a focus on financial econometrics.

Currently, my research focuses on:
- Monetary Policy and Central Bank Operations
- Density Forecasting and Forecast Evaluation
- Financial Stability and Macro-Financial Risk Modeling

I  develop open-source  software for  economics  and central  banking use,  in
particular  for  density   forecasting.  You  can  find  them   on  my  [Github
page](https://github.com/romainlafarguette)
