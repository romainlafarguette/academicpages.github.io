Welcome to the website of Romain Lafarguette (罗哲文), Ph.D., economist at the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC. 

I work for the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF. My work is
divided between:
1. [Academic research](https://romainlafarguette.github.io/research/)
2. [IMF country missions](https://romainlafarguette.github.io/country/)
3. [Software development for central banks and economists](https://romainlafarguette.github.io/software/)

My  main research  interests  lie  in the  fields  of  monetary and  financial
economics with a strong focus on financial econometrics.

I have been recently working on:
- Monetary Policy and Central Bank Operations
- Density Forecasting and Forecast Evaluation
- Financial Stability and Macro-Financial Risk Modeling

I  develop open-source  software for  economics  and central  banking use,  in
particular  for  density   forecasting.  You  can  find  them   on  my  [Github
page](https://github.com/romainlafarguette)
