This  paper  examines  the  role   of  rising  housing  prices  and  borrowing
constraints as determinants of China's  high household saving rate, especially
among young  households. Using a  life-cycle model  of saving behavior  in the
presence  of borrowing  constraints,  we show  that  the relationship  between
housing prices and saving exists only under certain conditions and for certain
groups of households.  Specifically, when the return  on financial instruments
is low (which is  the case in China), the saving rate  of young households may
increase with housing prices. This  relationship, moreover, is non- linear and
depends on the  level of wealth. Employing an empirical  strategy motivated by
the theoretical model, we analyze a dataset of over six thousand Chinese urban
households  spanning the  years 1995,  2002 and  2007. We  find evidence  that
higher  housing  prices  do  in  fact  increase  the  saving  rates  of  young
households. We also find evidence for the predicted non-linearity.
